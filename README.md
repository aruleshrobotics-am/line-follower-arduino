#line-follower-arduino
This project demonstrates a basic line-following robot built and simulated in Tinkercad using an Arduino Uno, two IR sensors, and an L293D motor driver.

The robot uses differential motor speed control to follow a line:

Turns right when the line is detected on the left

Turns left when the line is detected on the right

Moves straight when both sensors are off

The circuit is intentionally wired without a breadboard, using direct connections for simplicity and experimentation.
This project is intended for beginners to understand sensor-based decision making, motor control, and closed-loop feedback before moving to real hardware.
